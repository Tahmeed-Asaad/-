When we are dealing with classification, there are many problems that we can face. One of them is class imbalance: having one overrepresented and one heavily underrepresented class. A model that predicts really well in this case based on accuracy is mainly due toÂ [Class Imbalance](http://www.chioka.in/class-imbalance-problem/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Class%20Imbalance,class%20of%20data%20(negative). For example, 1 values are actually new recommendations, so a model that predicts more 1's even if they don't match just means we have more items to recommend.
