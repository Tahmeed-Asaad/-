<strong>1. Installation</strong>
<p>There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.</p>
<strong>2. Project Motivation</strong>
<p>Due to Covid-19 outbreak, tourism, hospitality, and real estate industries were struggled.
<br/>
In order to stimulate the economy, AU government offered great benefits for property investors. I am interested to find out insights to support an investing idea through the Melbourneâ€™s Airbnb data.
<br/> 
There are four questions I am expecting to find answers:
<br/>
<p>Q1: How is the rental market performing in Melbourne on Airbnb?</p>
<p>Q2: What areas have a greater chance to rend out properties?</p>
<p>Q3: What type of property should I invest in?</p>
<p>Q4: How do price and review scores affect rental properties?</p>

<strong>3. File Descriptions</strong>
<p>A notebook is available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each cell has a sentence at the top for describing the purpose of the code.
Two data sets (Listings and Calendar) are used, and the data were scraped on 05/11/20</p>

<strong>4. Results</strong>
<p>The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.</p>
