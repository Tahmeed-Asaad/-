Astute Udacity Learner,

Great job on this submission.

You've made a great effort in your work in the project! Your submission is almost there in terms of meeting specifications, but there are a few issues that need to be revised before the project can pass all rubric points. I believe that it would take very little time for you to make the adjustments.

Don't get upset or disappointed, you did a great job which deserves a big compliment, think that those changes are a great opportunity to learn more and perfect your skills.

I wish you good luck with your Nanodegree. Looking forward to your next submission.

Stay Udacious and stay safe! ![:smiley:](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ssk5tabo4pl_wAbd-dLFjgbj2FXviO0-pepBsaamQM1FsAQN1JgMUFauxHIYgWzCNdDHRI9GwfoGawnBJrwOy49kRNQsd8v1yEQz2uaGXrFNKAyl15Bgeva_fc1r0F2Qr4CHrjhk ":smiley:")
